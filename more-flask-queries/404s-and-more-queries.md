## Goals

Our goal for this lesson is to apply our learnings about edge cases from RESTful API design. We should walk away from this lesson understanding how to write more robust Flask code.

This lesson covers:

- Handling when a resource isn't found
- Exploring more query functionality made available by Flask-SQLAlchemy

## Hello Books API

### Before This Lesson

This lesson uses the Hello Books API.

<br />

<details style="max-width: 700px; margin: auto;">
    <summary>
        Before beginning this lesson, the Hello Books API should have the following.
    </summary>

- A `hello_books_development` database
- A `book` table defined
- A `Book` model defined
- Endpoints defined for these RESTful routes:
- `GET` to `/books`
- `POST` to `/books`
- `GET` to `/books/<book_id>`
- `PUT` to `/books/<book_id>`
- `DELETE` to `/books/<book_id>`

The `Book` model and table should have the following columns:

- `id`
- `title`
- `description`

</details>

## `GET`ting a Missing Book: Preparation

Let's consider how to accomplish this feature:

> As a client, I want to send a request trying to get one non-existing book and get a 404 response, so I know that the book resource was not found.

### Planning HTTP Requests, Responses, and Logic

This feature is a variation on our existing endpoint that reads a record, but it uses an invalid id. As a result, we can use the following verb and endpoint combination.

| HTTP Method | Endpoint          |
| ----------- | ----------------- |
| `GET`       | `/books/99999999` |

As with our existing `GET` requests, we do not send a request body.

We want to inform the client that the record was not found. The most appropriate response status code is `404 Not Found`. We could return an error message that echoes back the id the client submitted, but for simplicity, we'll only return the status code and leave the body empty.

| Response Status | Response Body |
| --------------- | ------------- |
| `404 Not Found` | -             |

Now that we have planned out the endpoint behavior, we can turn our attention to how to implement it.

Our endpoint will need to:

1. Read the `book_id` in the request path
1. Retrieve the book with the matching `book_id` from the db
1. Discover that there is no matching book with `book_id` in the db
1. Send back a response

### Working More With `query`

We've been retrieving our `Book` instance with the line `Book.query.get(book_id)`. What does this method do when there is no matching book?

When `Model.query.get(primary_key)` doesn't find a matching record, it returns `None`!

## `GET`ting a Missing Book: Code

This endpoint uses the same path as our existing parameterized route, `"/<book_id>"`, so we can re-work it to add our new behavior.

Let's modify our endpoint code to report a not found status when trying to `GET` a book.

```python
@books_bp.route("/<book_id>", methods=["GET", "PUT", "DELETE"])
def handle_book(book_id):
    book = Book.query.get(book_id)

    if request.method == "GET":
        if book is None:
            return make_response("", 404)
        return {
            "id": book.id,
            "title": book.title,
            "description": book.description
        }
    # ... existing code for updating a single book
    # ... existing code for deleting a single book
```

| <div style="min-width:250px;"> Piece of Code </div> | Notes                                                                                       |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `if book is None:`                                  | This checks if `Book.query.get(book_id)` returned `None` because there was no matching book |
| `return make_response("", 404)`                   | We sent back an empty string as our empty response body and set the status code to `404 Not Found`                                     |

### Manually Testing in Postman

After writing this code, we can use Postman to test it. Let's make a `GET` request to `/books/99999999`.

![Screenshot of Postman featuring a request of GET to /books/99999999 and a response of 404](../assets/update-and-delete/404s-and-more-queries_get-missing-book.png)

We should see a `404` status and an empty response body.

## Countless Possible Refactorings

Handling a missing book and sending back a 404 happens to be the same response we want for all three endpoints:

- `GET` `/books/<book_id>`
- `PUT` `/books/<book_id>`
- `DELETE` `/books/<book_id>`

While we _could_ duplicate the `None` check we added to the `GET` branch in each of the other cases, a simpler approach is to handle the `None` check before even checking for the verb. This lets us handle all three cases with a single piece of logic!

Let's make the change and then test our API, making sure each verb case works as expected!

```python
@books_bp.route("/<book_id>", methods=["GET", "PUT", "DELETE"])
def handle_book(book_id):
    book = Book.query.get(book_id)
    if book is None:
        return make_response("", 404)

    if request.method == "GET":
        return {
            "id": book.id,
            "title": book.title,
            "description": book.description
        }
    # ... existing code for updating a single book
    # ... existing code for deleting a single book
```

## Even More Refactoring

There is no single correct way to structure our code. We could refactor our code to any number of different solutions. Feel free to refactor!

## More About Queries

[There's more to explore with querying](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/queries/#querying-records)! Let's touch on two topics.

### Filter By

We can use the method `filter_by()` in order to filter our search query. We can give keyword arguments to describe the attribute and value on which we're filtering. Consider this example that filters `Book`s by title.

```python
Book.query.filter_by(title="Fictional Book Title")
```

## Pro-Tip: Experiment in Flask With Experimental Endpoints

Take the time to experiment in your Flask API! Consider making a small experimental endpoint that will never be committed to Git.

### !end-callout

### Limits

We can limit the number of results in our queries by using `limit()`. Consider this example that gets the first 100 `Book` records.

```python
Book.query.limit(100).all()
```
