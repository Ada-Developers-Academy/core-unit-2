# Deploying to Render

## Goal

Our goal for this lesson is to:
* Practice the process of deploying a Flask API to Render.

We will outline the following steps in order to do an initial deploy to Render:

1. Create a Render account
2. Connect our Render account to our GitHub account
3. Configure our Flask app for Render
4. Create a Render app via their web launcher
5. Create a PostgreSQL database in Render
6. Initialize the database
7. Set the environment variables for our Render app
8. Verify

Then, we will cover these topics on continuous deployment to Render:

1. General Render tools
2. General Render debugging strategies

## Branches

| Starting Branch | Ending Branch|
|--|--|
|`08b-nested-routes` <br> Any branch after connecting the database will work |`09a-deploying-to-render`|

### Intro to Render

[Render](https://render.com/) is one Platform as a Service (PaaS). We can use Render services to deploy our Flask API. After we successfully deploy, our API will be available to the whole Internet!

![Screenshot of Render.com's splash page](../assets/deployment/deployment_render-splash.png)

We are choosing Render as a deployment platform because:

- It is a trusted, popular platform with a large, supportive community
- It has free features that fulfill our needs
  - It supports Python and Flask deployment
  - It supports Postgres databases
- It is appropriate for small, individual projects (as well as large ones)
- It uses Git as part of its development workflow
- It has a simple user interface

## Create a Render Account

Create an account on [Render](https://dashboard.render.com/register?next=%2Fregisterundefined).

Render will send a verification message to the email you use to register. The email will include a link that brings you to your dashboard.

![Screenshot of Account Verification Email from Render](../assets/deployment/deployment_render-verification-email.png)

As a new user, our dashboard should display a quick start guide. 

![Screenshot of the Render New User Dashboard](../assets/deployment/deployment_render-new-user-dash.png)

Once we have added applications, our dashboard will change to show a list of all our deployed applications. 

![Screenshot of the Render Dashboard with three apps listed in it](../assets/deployment/deployment_dashboard-with-apps-render.png)

## Connect Render Account to GitHub

Connecting our Render account with our GitHub account allows us to link our project repository to our Render application. 

To connect our Render and GitHub accounts, we can click on our user profile in the upper righthand corner of Render, then select "Account Settings". 

![Screenshot of User Dropdown Menu](../assets/deployment/deployment_account-settings-render.png)

Under the Profile section of the Account Settings page, click the "Connect GitHub" button and sign in to GitHub as prompted. 

![Screenshot of Profile Section](../assets/deployment/deployment_profile-connect-Github-render.png)

When we have successfully linked our GitHub account to Render, the "Connect GitHub" button will be replaced with our GitHub username and an option to disconnect our GitHub account.

![Screenshot of Successful GitHub Connection](../assets/deployment/deployment_profile-with-connected-Github-render.png)


## Configure Our Flask App for Render

Although Render will do a lot of the work of hosting, running, and maintaining our API server, we need to add a small amount of configuration to our project.

### Check Dependencies for `gunicorn`

We will use a Python package named [gunicorn](https://pypi.org/project/gunicorn/) to launch our Flask API on Render.

`gunicorn` is capable of running Flask apps so that they can handle multiple simultaneous requests, which is very important for production web applications.

We should confirm that the package `gunicorn` is in the project's `requirements.txt` file.

If `gunicorn` does _not_ appear in our `requirement.txt`, we can add it by installing it locally with:

```bash
(venv) $ pip install gunicorn
```

After it has installed, we can update our `requirements.txt` by running:

```bash
(venv) $ pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

Render makes use of our `requirements.txt` file to install our app dependencies, so it is very important to ensure that all of our dependencies are properly listed.

If we needed to update our `requirements.txt`, we should be sure to add and commit this change.

## Create a Render App

For each project we deploy, we will need to create and manage a Render app. Our Render app will give us visibility, access, and tools to manage our deployed app.

To create our Render app, click the "New" button in the top navigation bar, and then choose "Web Service". 

![Create New Web Service Button Screenshot](../assets/deployment/deployment_new_web_service_render.png)

Next, we can use the search bar to find our Hello Books API GitHub repository. Click the "Connect" button next to our project repository to link it to our new application. 

Note that we should use _our fork_ of the Hello Books API repo which is listed under our GitHub username. So we should search for `your-github-username/hello-books-api`. We are working with the AdaGold version only for the purposes of this walk-through. 

![Screenshot of selecting the AdaGold/hello-books-api Repo](../assets/deployment/deployment_connect-app-to-repo-render.png)

Enter `your-app-name` into the "Name" field to create an app with the name `your-app-name`. 

Replace `your-app-name` with the desired name of the app.

![Screenshot of Render after adding the app name](../assets/deployment/deployment_connect-app-to-repo-render.png)

Note that the app name must be unique across all Render apps, not just our own apps. As a result, the name `hello-books-api` is already taken, as it was used in this walk-through! We will need to come up with our own name that has a unique touch.

<!-- Add comment about Render tacking on random characters for non-unique names-->

Next, change the "Branch" field to set which branch we want to pull our code from for our deployed applicaton. Most of the time we will choose `main`, but in the case of the Hello Books API repo, we don't have a `main` branch. Instead we want to choose the branch that includes all the code and latest changes we want to be a part of our deployed app. For us, that should be `08b-nested-routes` or any later branch. 

![Screenshot of Render after adding choosing branch 08b-nested-routes](../assets/deployment/deployment_choose-web-service-name-render.png)

Next, we need to alter the "Start Command" field which defaults to the value `$ gunicorn app: app`. This field defines where in our code the `gunicorn` package should look to find what it needs to start our Flask web server. 

Update the "Start Command" field to `$ gunicorn "app:create_app()"`.

![Screenshot of changing app start command to gunicorn "app:create_app()"](../assets/deployment/deployment_change-start-command-render.png)

Finally, scroll down to the bottom of the page and click the "Create Web Service" button.

![Screenshot of Creating Web Service in Render](../assets/deployment/deployment_create-web-service-render.png)

### !callout-warning

## Render Free App Limits

Render's free tier only supports a single full stack application (front end app, backend app, and Postgres database). If we want to deploy a second app, we will need to suspend or delete any other apps we have deployed. 

### !end-callout

### Our New Render App

Render will now begin to build our app. This may take several minutes. If our app successfully deploys, we will see a  `Your service is live ðŸŽ‰` message appear in the logs section at the bottom of the screen.

![Screenshot of the your service is live message in the logs of a successfully deployed Render app](../assets/deployment/deployment_successful-deployment-logs-render.png)

Our Render app is not connected to a Postgres database yet, so we cannot make HTTP requests with our routes successfully at this stage.

### !callout-info

## Render Still Ignores Files

Since we are using GitHub to give Render access to our code, this means Render will _not_ have access to any files listed in our `.gitignore`, including our `.env` file. This means our environment variables, which include our connection strings, are unseen by Render! We'll learn how to tell our app where to find our database later in this lesson.

### !end-callout

### Verify in the Dashboard

We can verify our app was created by navigating to our main [Render dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com/).

Our new app is now listed! We'll visit this dashboard whenever we need to see or update details of our Render apps. We can access the individual app's dashboard by clicking on the app where it is listed in our dashboard.

![Screenshot of the Render dashboard with the new hello-books-api app listed](../assets/deployment/deployment_render-dashboard-new-app.png)

## Create a Database in Render

Now that we've created our Render app for the first time, we need to tell the app we're interested in adding a Postgres database to our deployed Render app.

To create a new Postgres database, click the "New" button in the top navigation bar, then choose "PostgreSQL". 

![Screenshot of selecting new PostgreSQL service](../assets/deployment/deployment_new-postgres-db-render.png)

Just as with our web service, we need to give our database a name. Enter `your-database-name` into the "Name" field. 

Replace `your-database-name` with the desired name of the Postgres database. 

![Screenshot of new PostgreSQL database with name hello-books-api-db](../assets/deployment/deployment_set-postgres-db-name-render.png)

Finally, scroll down to the bottom of the current page and click _Create Database_. 

![Screenshot of Create Database button on Render](../assets/deployment/deployment_create-database-render.png)

Render will bring us to our new database's "Info" section. The "Status" field will show that it is "Creating" the database. Creating the database may take several minutes. 

![Screenshot of hello-books-api database being created](../assets/deployment/deployment_database-status-creating-render.png)

Once the database is successfully created, the "Status" field will change to "Available." 

![Screenshot of hello-books-api database with status available](../assets/deployment/deployment_database-with-available-status-render.png)

### Verify in the Dashboard

We can verify that our Postgres database was successfully created by visiting the [Render dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com/).

Our new database should now be listed above our application.

![Screenshot of the Render dashboard showing the new hello-books-api-db database](../assets/deployment/deployment_dashboard-with-db-and-web-service-render.png)

### Setup and Initialize the Render Database

We now have our database, but it is empty. Just as we did with the [Postgres database on our local machine](../api-3-database-models-read/models-setup.md), we need to perform a database migration to update the Render database to our latest schema.

To perform the migration, click on the database where it is listed in the Render dashboard to open the database's info and settings. Then click the "Connect" button in the upper right hand corner and select "External Connection". Copy the "External Database URL." 

![Screenshot of Connect window with External Database URL copied](../assets/deployment/deployment_external-database-url-render.png)

Your external database URL will look something like the following:

```
postgres://YOUR_DATABASE_USERNAME:CONNECTION-STRING.oregon-postgres.render.com/YOUR_DATABASE
```
Render generated `YOUR_DATABASE_USERNAME` and `YOUR_DATABASE` when we first set up our database. We can find what they are by checking our database's "Info" page and scrolling down to the "Connections" subsection. 

![Screenshot of the Connections section on the Info page for our Render Postgres Database](../assets/deployment/deployment_render-db-connections-section.png)

In our case `YOUR_DATABASE_USERNAME` is `hello_books_api_db_h25f_user` (listed as the "Username" on our database's dashboard) and `YOUR_DATABASE` is `hello_books_api_db_h25f` (listed as the "Database" on our database's dashboard).

`CONNECTION-STRING` will be a long series of random characters. 

Navigate to the `.env` file in our project's root directory in VS Code. Create a new environment variable `RENDER_DATABASE_URL` to hold our external database URL. 

```
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI=postgresql+psycopg2://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/hello_books_development
SQLALCHEMY_TEST_DATABASE_URI=postgresql+psycopg2://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/hello_books_test
RENDER_DATABASE_URL = postgres://YOUR_DATABASE_USERNAME:CONNECTION-STRING.oregon-postgres.render.com/YOUR_DATABASE
```

We need to modify the start of our external database URL to work with the version of SQLAlchemy we are using. Update the beginning of our external database URL from `postgres` to `postgresql+pyscopg2`.

```
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI=postgresql+psycopg2://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/hello_books_development
SQLALCHEMY_TEST_DATABASE_URI=postgresql+psycopg2://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/hello_books_test
RENDER_DATABASE_URL = postgresql+psycopg2://YOUR_DATABASE_USERNAME:CONNECTION-STRING.oregon-postgres.render.com/YOUR_DATABASE
```

Next we want to update `app/__init__.py` so that `app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI']` references the connection string for our new Render database instead of our locally hosted database.

```py
from flask import Flask
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
from flask_migrate import Migrate

db = SQLAlchemy()
migrate = Migrate()

def create_app(test_config=None):
    app = Flask(__name__)

    app.config['SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS'] = False
    app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = os.environ.get("RENDER_DATABASE_URL")

    db.init_app(app)
    migrate.init_app(app, db)

    from .routes import books_bp
    app.register_blueprint(books_bp)

    return app
```

Finally, we can apply the generated migrations to our new Render database by running the following in our terminal.

```
(venv) $ flask db upgrade
```

This will migrate the empty database in our remote Postgres connection to the latest schema configuration we have generated from our models. 

## Set Environment Variables in Render

Our Render database now has the correct schema but it is still not connected to our deployed application.

Our current app sets the `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI` configuration setting using the environment variable `RENDER_DATABASE_URL` in our `.env` file. Our Flask code accesses this environment variable with the code `os.environ.get("RENDER_DATABASE_URI")`.

Instead of giving Render our `.env` file, we need to add our environment variables to Render using the Render dashboard.

### Find the Internal Database URL in Render

First, let's find the internal connection string that will connect to our Render database to our deployed application. 

In our database's dashboard on Render, click on the "Connect" button in the upper right corner and copy the value of the "_Internal_ Database URL."

![Screenshot of the Connections section on the Info page for our Render Postgres Database](../assets/deployment/deployment_database-internal-connection-string-render.png)


### Set the Environment Variables in Render

Next, we need to set the `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI` variable as an environment variable of our web service application. 

Navigate to our web service application's dashboard.

![Screenshot of hello-books-api dashboard](../assets/deployment/deployment_web-service-app-dashboard-render.png)

In the "Environment" section:

1. Click "Add Environment Variable" in the "Environment Variables" section
2. Set the key as `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`
3. Set the value of this variable to the internal connection string we copied
4. Modify the value of the internal connection string so that the beginning reads `postgresql+psycopg2` instead of `postgres`
5. Click "Save Changes"

![Screenshot of the Render dashboard at the Settings tab, showing the detail of revealed Config vars. The SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI variable is present](../assets/deployment/deployment_set-environment-var-render.png)

## Verify

Our Flask project is on a Render machine, running, and connected to an initialized database. Now is the time to verify whether our API is accessible by web!

### Use the Browser

We can use the browser to make `GET` requests to any endpoint defined in our project, now using our deployed Render URL instead of `localhost`.

We can find our URL on our deployed application's dashboard, listed just under the name of our web service application. Render URLs will take the form `https://your-app-name.onrender.com` Our demonstration has the URL `https://hello-books-api.onrender.com`.

![Screenshot of Render URL for deployed hello-books-api application with copy to clipboard message](../assets/deployment/deployment_deployed-web-service-url-render.png)

### !callout-warning

## Routing Configurations May Result in a `404 Not Found`
Recall that Flask routes are very picky about `/` characters. Some browsers will try to put a `/` character at the end of an address automatically. Depending on how our routes are set up, this might result in a route mismatch.

<br />

Also note that our API does not define the endpoint for our base URL, thus sending a `GET` request to our base Render URL `https://your-app-name.onrender.com/` will result in a `404 Not Found` error. However sending a `GET` request to `https://your-app-name.onrender.com/books` should return a `200 OK` status code because our project defines that route.

<br />

Our Flask API isn't _intended_ to be used through a web browser. It's meant to be used programmatically. It's convenient if testing through a browser works, but if it doesn't we can move on to test with Postman.

### !end-callout

Instead of `localhost:5000/books`, we can visit `https://your-app-name.onrender.com/books`, where `your-app-name` is the name of our Render app.

![Screenshot of the browser open to the deployed API, showing a response of an empty JSON array](../assets/deployment/deployment_deployed-books.png)

### !callout-info

## No Book Data

Our app has zero books listed when we go to `/books`, even though our app is deployed correctly and connected to our Postgres database correctly.

<br />


<details>

<summary>Why are there no books listed?</summary>

<br />

Recall that our deployed app is connected to a Postgres database that we created a few steps ago! We have not added any book data to our Render database. Even if our local database is full of books, our Render app's database connection string points at the Render database. 

</details>

### !end-callout

### Use Postman

We can use Postman to make and verify all sorts of HTTP requests to our API!

### Use Render Logs

During local development on our own machines, when we ran `$ flask run`, the server's logs were output into our terminal. We could see the details about every HTTP request our server received and every HTTP response it returned. We could also see output for any errors.

We can access the server logs of our Render app from our app's Render dashboard by finding the "More" menu and selecting "Logs."

It reports the HTTP requests, responses, and errors that our Render app encounters.

![Screenshot of the Render logs, showing examples of different HTTP requests and responses](../assets/deployment/deployment_render-logs.png)

## Updating the Render Remote Workflow

When we practice _continuous deployment_, we must adopt the practice of regularly updating the Git history of our Render app.

We can summarize our local development workflow like this:

1. Activate our virtual environment
1. Pull down any new commits from Git
1. Run tests
1. Write code
1. Make Git commits
2. Push our Git history to the `origin` remote, which is our repo on GitHub
3. Verify our deployment

## General Deployment Tools

We can continue to use the browser and Postman to create HTTP requests and check their HTTP responses!

### Render Tools in the Dashboard

The Render dashboard includes:

- Access to app dashboards for deployed apps
- Access to the Render logs
- Management of environment variables
- History of "Latest Activity," which will show the timeline of recent deployments

## General Render Debugging Strategies

Sometimes, after deployment, our deployed app doesn't behave as expected. This could be a bug, and it could also be our web server catching an exception.

Our deployed apps can encounter problems ranging from:

- Problems with our own Flask code, such as broken syntax or buggy features
- Our database not being connected or initialized properly
- Our Render machine not downloading and installing the correct dependencies
- Render.com itself being down, or improper use of Render tools

In those situations, here is a starting point for debugging and determining what is causing the deployment error:

| <div style="min-width:200px;">Debugging Action</div>                          | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Check the logs                            | The logs will show error messages that the web server outputs. These messages could share details such as Python `NameError`s, database connection errors, problems with running the Flask app, problems with downloading the right packages, etc. |
| See if you can recreate it locally        | Attempt to recreate the problem locally, by running `$ flask run` on your own local machine. Error messages may be more detailed on our local machine. Also, concluding that you're **unable to recreate the issue** is valuable in itself!        |

| Internet research!                        | Render has a large community of support, and a lot of documentation on deploying Flask apps and using Postgres databases. Be sure to use the Internet and to rubber duck with others.                                                              |
| Take notes of each debugging attempt      | It can be challenging to remember what you've tried on the Render machine. Write down and record all of the ways you've attempted to fix the problem.                                                                                              |
