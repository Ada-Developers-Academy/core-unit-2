# Instructor: Intro to API Design

## Designing Responses

Goal:

- The point is to get students to learn that they can shape their JSON meaningfully.
- My hope is that if they learn how to shape it meaningfully, they'll be better equipped to dive into the JSON, too.
- Bonus: Practice for capstone

Notes for teaching:

- The first half is boring, it's stuff that's been taught before
- The second half has an extended metaphor/walkthrough with Eryn, and then it ends in Slack API exploration

## Activity

This is one of those activities where the conversation is more important than the outcome.

Encourage questions. API design in the wild is varied, and it's all about context. More APIs break rules than not, so I wouldn't stress about naming any specific answers.

The activity should be practicing skills that mimic capstone. (How do we go from feature to API?)
