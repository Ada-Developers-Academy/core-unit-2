# Problem Set: Read, Update, and Delete

## Directions

Complete all directions below.

There is no submission for this assignment.

On your machine, keep:

- Your completed repo
- A list of any questions you weren't able to research independently

## Practice

Continue your independent Hello Books API.

Fulfill the following requirements, with the same functionality presented in this topic:

As a client, I want to send a request...

1. ... to get one existing book, so that I can see the `id`, `title`, and `description` of the book.
1. ... with valid `book` data to update one existing `book` and get a success response, so that I know the API updated the book data.
1. ... to delete one existing `book` and get a success response, so that I know the API deleted the book data.

* Each of the above endpoints should respond with a `404` for non-existing books and a `400` for invalid `book_id`.*
