# Deleting Records

## Learning Goals

- Practice deleting records from a table

## Introduction

Zahra is a user of a chat app, which allows her to add and manage her different contacts. She can select a contact and talk with them, categorize her contacts, and update contact information.

Unfortunately Zahra realizes that she put in two entries for a particular friend.  She only needs the one entry and so she wants to remove the duplicate entry.

Consider this feature:

1. As a user, I should be able to delete contacts so I can remove entries I do not need.

Now, imagine that this chat app had a database and table like this:

**Table**: `contact`

| `contact_id` (`INT`) | `name` (`VARCHAR(100)`) | `category` (`VARCHAR(50)`) |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `278`                | `'Cheyenne O''Brien'`   | `'Best Freinds'`           |
| `279`                | `'Adina Lennon'`        | `'Best Freinds'`           |
| `280`                | `'Jett Sargent'`        | `NULL`                     |
| `281`                | `'Eliot Giles'`         | `'Adies'`                  |

Imagine you're a programmer on this chat app. How would you accomplish changing the data to implement this feature? What do you need to consider?

## Removing Records With `DELETE`

Before we delete a record in a table, we should first determine:

- Which table contains the data we need to delete
- Which record(s) need to be removed
  - How can we determine how to accurately find these records, and only these records?

### !callout-danger

## Can Delete Multiple Records At Once

Postgres, and all relational databases support deleting one or multiple records at once.  This can be **dangerous** because a mistake could cause unintentional deletions!

### !end-callout

To delete a record(s), we use the following SQL syntax:

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

| Piece of Code                             | Notes                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DELETE`                                  | Keyword that begins an deletion statement                                                 |
| `table_name`                              | **Replace this** with the name of the correct table                                     |
| `WHERE`                                   | Keyword that begins a where-clause, where you determine what gets deleted               |
| `condition;`                              | **Replace this** with a condition that must be **true** in order for a record to be deleted |

_The `WHERE` clause is optional_. Without a `WHERE` clause, all records within the table will be removed!.

### !callout-danger

## Without `WHERE`, All Are Deleted

If you omit the WHERE clause, ALL records will be deleted!

### !end-callout

### Example and Output

Imagine the following table named `media` with these columns and four records.

| `media_id` | `category` | `title`         | `creator`      | `publication_year` | `description_text`                    |
| ---------- | ---------- | --------------- | -------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| 1          | book       | Red Java        | Jewel Koss     | 1971               | Nisi ducimus reprehenderit molestiae. |
| 2          | book       | Postmodern Been | Glen Senger    | 1929               | Dolore repellendus doloribus maiores. |
| 3          | movie      | American Select | Xuan Pouros    | 1997               | Corporis id voluptatem fuga.          |
| 4          | movie      | Wake-up Utopia  | Buena Shanahan | 1930               | Fuga corrupti ducimus animi.          |

After running this SQL statement...

```sql
DELETE FROM media
WHERE id = 3;
```

our `media` table will look like this:

| `media_id` | `category` | `title`         | `creator`      | `publication_year` | `description_text`                    |
| ---------- | ---------- | --------------- | -------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| 1          | book       | Red Java        | Jewel Koss     | 1971               | Nisi ducimus reprehenderit molestiae. |
| 2          | book       | Postmodern Been | Glen Senger    | 1929               | Dolore repellendus doloribus maiores. |
| 3          | movie      | üçÄ              | Xuan Pouros    | 1997               | Corporis id voluptatem fuga.          |
| 4          | movie      | Wake-up Utopia  | Buena Shanahan | 1930               | Fuga corrupti ducimus animi.          |

After running this SQL statement...

```sql
UPDATE media
SET description_text = 'üçÄ';
```

our `media` table will look like this:

| `media_id` | `category` | `title`         | `creator`      | `publication_year` | `description_text` |
| ---------- | ---------- | --------------- | -------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| 1          | book       | Red Java        | Jewel Koss     | 1971               | üçÄ                 |
| 2          | book       | Postmodern Been | Glen Senger    | 1929               | üçÄ                 |
| 3          | movie      | üçÄ              | Xuan Pouros    | 1997               | üçÄ                 |
| 4          | movie      | Wake-up Utopia  | Buena Shanahan | 1930               | üçÄ                 |

### Examples on Updating Records

Read through these example SQL statements. For each example, read the code and answer:

1. What is the name of the table?
1. For each column-value pair, what is the column and what is the value?
1. What kinds of record(s) will be updated?

1. Update all records to have an `author_name` value `"(No Author)"`

```sql
UPDATE authors
SET author_name = '(No Author)';
```

2. Update the record with `id` `2` so the `is_available` attribute is `false`. (Update Driver #2 to be unavailable.)

```sql
UPDATE drivers
SET is_available = false
WHERE id = 2;
```

3. Update the record with `id` `1` so `publication_year` is `"1990"` _and_ `description_text` is `NULL`. (Update Media #1 with a new publication year and empty description.)

```sql
UPDATE media
SET publication_year = '1990', description_text = NULL
WHERE media_id = 1;
```

4. Update all records with the category `"album"` to the category `"Album"`. (Rename category `"album"` to `"Album"`.)

```sql
UPDATE media
SET category = 'Album'
WHERE category = 'album';
```

### Feedback on Updating Records

A successful update will print out `UPDATE #`, where `#` is the number of records updated.

For example, an update of 3 records will print out `UPDATE 3`.

An _invalid_ `UPDATE` statement will produce an error, and nothing will be updated.

For example, what happens if we try to update an ID column that has the constraint `GENERATED ALWAYS`?

```sql
UPDATE media
SET media_id = 800;
```

We would get output similar to:

```
ERROR:  column "media_id" can only be updated to DEFAULT
DETAIL:  Column "media_id" is an identity column defined as GENERATED ALWAYS.
```

## Check for Understanding

* title: Updating Records
##### !question

Arrange the following syntax.

Assume the `hotel_guests` table is made with this SQL statement:

```sql
CREATE TABLE hotel_guests (
    guest_id INT PRIMARY KEY GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
    guest_name VARCHAR(200),
    is_checked_in BOOLEAN
)
```

##### !end-question
##### !answer

1. `UPDATE`
1. `hotel_guests`
1. `SET`
1. `is_checked_in = true`
1. `WHERE`
1. `guest_id = 47`
1. `;`

##### !end-answer
##### !hint

Because the `guest_id` column is `GENERATED ALWAYS`, we can assume that this statement is _not_ updating and setting the `guest_id = 47`.
