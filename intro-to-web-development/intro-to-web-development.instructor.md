# Instructor: Intro to Web Development

On the practical level, these subjects are not necessary for a web dev to know beyond definitions:

- HTTP
- HTTPS

Tips, especially for instructors who aren't deep in this knowledge:

- Genuinely possible to do the job without this knowledge
- Getting deeper can be distracting, or for roles that aren't entry-level web dev
  - Liken it to learning how materials get shipped between manufacturers while learning to be a clothes designer. It's useful, but so incredibly off the mark, that it's a compeltely different subject
  - Students who want to get deeper into this should look up topics about **networking**.

That being said, future topics will cover:

- HTTP Requests in depth
  - HTTP methods, headers, bodies, etc
- HTTP Responses in depth
  - HTTP status codes, etc etc etc
