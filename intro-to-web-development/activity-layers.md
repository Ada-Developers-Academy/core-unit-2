# Activity: Layers

## Goal

Our goal is to practice seeing how the following models apply to how web applications work:

1. client-server model
1. end-user, front-end layer, back-end layer, database

We should also practice seeing how different components of web applications communicate with each other.

## Activity Instructions

In very small groups (ideally 2-3 people), create a sequence diagram for each of the prompts below. Limit your time on each prompt.

When possible, these pairs of 2-3 people should compare and discuss their diagrams with another pair. Follow classroom instructions.

### Preparation

Groups will be making diagrams together during this time. Folks should prepare to collaborate, so preparing the following supplies is helpful:

- Physical supplies, such as paper, markers, pens, scissors, glue, etc.
- Screen sharing tools
- Diagram-making tools and digital drawing tools, such as canva.com, sketch.io, lucidchart.com, etc.

## No Perfect Answers

This activity is about how people interpret different processes. There is no perfect answer to any of these prompts, and most answers are valid!

## Prompts

1. Consider craigslist.com.

Imagine a user who wants to find all free-stuff for sale that has been posted today. (Consider this [page](https://seattle.craigslist.org/search/zip?postedToday=1) for Seattle's craiglist.)

Create a sequence diagram to describe what the user will do and see. Use the following objects/actors for this diagram:

1. End-user
1. Client (the end-user's browser)
1. Craigslist.com's web servers

1. Consider craigslist.com.

Imagine a user who wants to find all books that have delivery available. (Consider this [page](https://seattle.craigslist.org/search/bka?purveyor-input=all&delivery_available=1) for Seattle's craiglist.)

Create a sequence diagram to describe what the user will do and see. Use the following objects/actors for this diagram:

1. End-user
1. Craigslist.com front-end
1. Craigslist.com back-end
1. Craigslist.com databases

1. With your pair, create a fictional e-commerce online store. Pick something along the lines of "an online store for books about plants," or "an online store for antique/historical armor," or "an online store for pet clothes." Give this fictional online store a name.

Then, imagine a user who wants to write a review for a product.

Create a sequence diagram to describe what the user will do and see. Use the following objects/actors for this diagram:

1. End-user
1. Client (the end-user's browser)
1. Your online store's web servers

1. Continue to use the same fictional e-commerce store.

Continue to imagine a user who wants to write a review for a product.

Create a sequence diagram to describe what the user will do and see. Use the following objects/actors for this diagram:

1. End-user
1. Your online store's front-end
1. Your online store's back-end
1. Your online store's databases

## How to Review

1. What kinds of fictional online stores did each group create?
1. Compare diagrams from the fictional online store prompts between small groups.
   - What was different?
   - What was similar?
1. How could you apply these diagrams about the client-server model to a website you use frequently?
1. After comparing diagrams and seeing many examples, what is the level of detail that seems most useful to the group? Do you naturally want to make diagrams not detailed enough, or too detailed? What could you do in order to achieve the right amount of detail?
