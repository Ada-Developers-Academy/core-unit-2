# Activity: Mind Map

## Goals

- Reflect on our learning this Unit
- Make connections between different concepts

## Introduction

Wow! We've learned so much in this unit. Let's take time to reflect on our learning and make connections.

We will use a technique called a mind map. A mind map is a diagram that can represent tasks, ideas, concepts, etc. and the connections between them. 

## Examples

To learn more about the benefits of mind mapping, read this mind map!

Here's a mind map an individual shared of their life which demonstrates the power of making connections across different areas.

## Activity Instructions

Let's create a mind map. A mind map is a diagram that can represent tasks, ideas, and concepts, and the connections between them. In general, boxes are single concepts. Arrows and lines are made between concepts to show that they are connected somehow.

In our case, let's include any topic from our learnings from this unit. We should consider:
- Python programming concepts
- Study skills
- Learnings about how to be in community
- Anything else!

We can make our mind map using any of these tools:
- [Google Slide](https://www.google.com/slides/about/)
- [Mind Meister](https://www.mindmeister.com/)
- [Software from this list of mind mapping software](https://zapier.com/blog/best-mind-mapping-software/)

Spend approximately 40 minutes in small groups to work together and include all the wisdom from our classmates. 

Take turns contributing the the diagram.

Then, come back together as a large group to share insights. We encourage you to start by answering the question "What was the favorite connection we made?".
