# Activity: Building an API

## Goal

Our goal for this activity is:

1. Review the steps for setting up a Flask app, the models, and endpoints with a small group
1. Practice the steps for setting up a Flask app, the models, and endpoints with a small group

## Preparation

Participants should be prepared to:

- Share their screen
- Share at least
- Be honest and patient
- Ask for help and offer help

### !callout-success

## New Concepts, Workflows, and Code (Oh My)

We are rapidly practicing new concepts, workflows, and code skills all at the same time! However, after each time we practice, we'll get stronger. Practice patience, enthusiasm, and confidence with yourselves and others.

### !end-callout

## Activity Instructions

Get into small groups, ideally 2-3 people.

Each small group should work through the prompts below. Each prompt should spark a small discussion. Groups should be eager to share their screen and share their code and notes.

Each group member should share at least one thought for each prompt, and actively participate.

## Prompts

### Definitions

Create a group definition for:

- Endpoint
- Model
- Migration

### Share Problem Set Work

Have at least one person share their work from the problem set.

This person should demonstrate:

- Activating a virtual environment
- Starting the Flask server
- Making an HTTP request
- Observing the HTTP response
- The endpoint code for that request and response

Group members who are not demonstrating should identify:

- An endpoint in code
- A model in code

### Group Debugging and Researching

Spend at most ten minutes discussing, debugging, and researching as a group:

- Any unresolved setup issues in their own Flask work
- Any lack of clarity or questions around the Flask work so far

After ten minutes, bring any unresolved issues outside of the activity.

### Optional: Create a Hello Zoo API

As a group, create a new Flask API together named "Hello Zoo." The purpose of this API is to create, store, and retrieve different animal information. This API should be almost entirely identical to the Hello Books API.

One member should drive this API building, by sharing their screen and recreating the Hello Books API on their computer. The other group members will navigate this member by offering guidance on what steps to take.

The group member who desires the most practice in confidence should drive this, and share their screen.

To begin this part of the activity, we recommend:

- Cloning or copying an empty Hello Books API
- Renaming this folder to `hello-zoo-api`

The group should create a model `Animal`, with any attributes that feel appropriate.

## How to Review

- What were some definitions for the following?
  - Endpoint
  - Model
  - Migration
- What are some reflections on Flask API development so far?
