## Practice

1. If you haven't already, fork and clone the Hello Books repo
1. Recreate the following steps of the Hello Books repo:
   1. Create a virtual environment
   1. Install the dependencies
   1. Create the database `hello_books`
   1. Create the `book` table with the columns `id`, `title`, and `description`
   1. Setup the `Book` model
1. Create the following endpoints, with the same functionality presented in this topic:
   1. As a client, I want to send a request with new valid book data and get a success response, so that I know the API saved the book data
   1. As a client, I want to send a request to get all existing books, so that I can see a list of books, with their `id`, `title`, and `description` of the book.
   1. As a client, I want to send a request to get one existing book, so that I can see the `id`, `title`, and `description` of the book.
