# Activity: Solar System API: Setup, Create, Read

## Goal

Our coding skills improve with repetition.

Our goal is to practice creating a minimal Flask API in a pair or group setting.

Pairing with other programmers will help create stronger understanding of the material, and improved skill at working with others. Software teams thrive on collaboration, so working side-by-side with someone while coding is vital!

In this activity, we will build a Solar System API. This API will store information about different planets.

## Activity Instructions

### Setup

- Follow instructions from class on how to find pair/group assignments
- Meet with your pair/group ðŸ‘‹
- Decide which members will take the driver and navigator roles

### Driver/Navigator Roles

Driver and navigator roles should switch at least daily.

Decide who will be the driver today. The person who most desires to practice confidence today should drive first.

### Build

1. cd in the Solar System API repo
1. Recreate the following setup steps of the Solar System API repo:
   1. Activate the virtual environment
   1. Create the database `solar_system_development`
   1. Setup the `Planet` model with the attributes `id`, `name`, and `description`, and one additional attribute
   1. Create a migration to add a table for the `Planet` model and then apply it. Confirm that the `planet` table has been created as expected.
1. Create or refactor the following endpoints, with similar functionality presented in the Hello Books API:
   1. As a client, I want to send a request with new valid planet data and get a success response, so that I know the API saved the planet data
   1. As a client, I want to send a request to get all existing planets, so that I can see a list of planets, with their `id`, `name`, `description`, and other data of the planet.
   1. As a client, I want to send a request to get one existing planet, so that I can see the `id`, `name`, `description`, and other data of the planet.

### Workflow

1. Create commits as you go
1. Push commits before the next activity
1. Finish this functionality with your pair before the next activity
