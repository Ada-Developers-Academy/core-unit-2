# Instructor: Sorting Algos

## Sorting Algorithms (Lesson)

A huge reason why we're teaching sorting algorithms is because it's considered "common knowledge" among traditional CS education.

I think it's worth mentioning that fact verbally, to help students understand what to get out of this.

If anyone asks, Python's default sort is a custom blend of insertion sort and merge sort, tuned so that it performs very well on both small and large data sets.
