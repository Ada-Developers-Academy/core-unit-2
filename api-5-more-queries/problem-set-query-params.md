# Problem Set: Query Params

## Directions

Complete all directions below.

There is no submission for this assignment.

On your machine, keep:

- Your completed repo
- A list of any questions you weren't able to research independently

## Practice

Continue your independent Hello Books API.

Fulfill the following requirements, with the same functionality presented in this topic:

As a client, I want to send a request...

1. ... to get a list of `book`s, restricted to those with a match in the `title`, so that I can find a book by a partial title.
2. ... to get a list of `book`s, restricted to those with a match in the `description`, so that I can find a book by a partial description.

I should be able to combine the effects of filtering by the `title` and `description` in order to filter results by multiple properties at once.
