## What About Error Handling?

There are many cases that weren't covered in this lesson, even though they are relevant to creating and reading `Book`s. For example, what happens if we make a `GET` request to `/books/this-book-doesnt-exist`? We are intentionally not covering these cases at the moment, to limit this lesson. However, hypothesize and research how to handle erroneous HTTP requests. Follow your curiosity!

## 404

```python  
@books_bp.route("/<book_id>", methods=["GET"])
def handle_book(book_id):
    for book in books:
        if book.id == book_id:
            return {
                "id": book.id,
                "title": book.title,
                "description": book.description,
            }

    return {"message":f"book {book_id} not found"}, 404
```

## 400

```python  
@books_bp.route("/<book_id>", methods=["GET"])
def handle_book(book_id):
    try:
        book_id = int(book_id)
    except:
        return {"message":f"book {book_id} invalid"}, 400


    for book in books:
        if book.id == book_id:
            return {
                "id": book.id,
                "title": book.title,
                "description": book.description,
            }

    return {"message":f"book {book_id} not found"}, 404
```

## Refactor with Helper function

```python 
def validate_book(book_id):
    try:
        book_id = int(book_id)
    except:
        abort(make_response({"message":f"book {book_id} invalid"}, 400))

    found = False
    for book in books:
        if book.id == book_id:
            found = True

    if found is False:
        abort(make_response({"message":f"book {book_id} not found"}, 404))
```

```python
@books_bp.route("/<book_id>", methods=["GET"])
def handle_book(book_id):
    validate_book(book_id)

    for book in books:
        if book.id == book_id:
            return {
                "id": book.id,
                "title": book.title,
                "description": book.description,
            }
```
