## Goals

Our goal for this lesson is to learn how to handle errors for the `GET`&nbsp;`/books/<book_id>` route.

In this lesson we will extend our Hello Books API to handle the following error cases for the RESTful route `GET` `/books/<book_id>`:

1. If no `Book` record matches the `book_id`, the server will return a `404 Not Found` response code with a message indicating that there are no `Book`s with `book_id`.
2. If `book_id` is not of type `int`, the server will return a `400 Bad Request` response code with a message indicating `book_id` is invalid.

## Handling a non-existing book

Let's examine the error we receive for a `GET` request to `/books/100`, a non-existing book, in our browser.

### !callout-info

## Error Details Appear Only in Debug Mode

If your browser displays a generic error message like `Internal Server Error` instead of the detailed error message shown above, stop your Flask server with `⌃C` (`Ctrl+C`), then restart it in debug mode with the command

<br />

`flask run --debug`

### !end-callout

We received an error message that should resemble the following.

> TypeError: The view function for 'books_bp.get_one_book' did not return a valid response. The function either returned None or ended without a return statement.

Reviewing the error message, we can see that the error is a `TypeError`. This alone doesn't tell us much, but the next part of the error message is more informative. The error message states that the view function for `books_bp.get_one_book` did not return a valid response. Specifically, it either returned `None` or ended without a return statement (in which case, Python still behaves as though the function returned `None`).

This is really helpful information! From the error message, we know that we should take a look at the `get_one_book` function that we registered on the `books_bp` blueprint. Here's our code:

```python
@books_bp.get("/<book_id>")
def get_one_book(book_id):
    book_id = int(book_id)
    for book in books:
        if book.id == book_id:
            return {
                "id": book.id,
                "title": book.title,
                "description": book.description,
            }
```

There is a single explicit `return` in this function, but we only reach it if the condition `book.id == book_id` is `True`. That is, we need to find a book with a matching ID in order for the `return` to execute. If we never find a book with a matching ID, the loop will complete without returning anything, eventually reaching the end of the function.

As we know, in Python, a function that completes without an explicit `return` statement still returns `None` behind the scenes. This behavior is what Flask is seeing, which triggers the error message.

### Handling a non-existing book: Preparation

To handle this scenario, we should return a response with a response body indicating that the book with `book_id` was not found and a `404 Not Found` response code, which is the standard code to indicate that a resource was not found.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
| Endpoint Detail | Notes |
| ------- | ------- |
| Request | `GET /books/100` |
| Response Status | `404 Not Found` |
| Response Body | `{"message": "book 100 not found"}` |
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

### Handling a non-existing book: Code

When we return a dictionary value to be converted to JSON, Flask will automatically set the response code to `200`. Flask provides a few ways to set a different response code. For basic cases, Flask lets us return a tuple containing a response body dictionary and a response code.

So to return a `404` response if the loop completes without returning, we can add a `return` statement after the loop like this:

```python
    return {"message": f"book {book_id} not found"}, 404
```

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
| Piece of Code | Notes |
| ------------- | ----- |
| `return ..., ...` | The comma means that this is returning a `tuple` of two values. Remember that it's not parentheses that make a `tuple` literal, but rather a comma. |
| `{"message": f"book {book_id} not found"}` | The first value in the `tuple`, `{"message": f"book {book_id} not found"}`, is the dictionary that will become the `JSON` response body. |
| `404` | The second value in the `tuple`, `404`, is the response code. |

    for book in books:
        if book.id == book_id:
            return {
                "id": book.id,
                "title": book.title,
                "description": book.description,
            }

    return {"message": f"book {book_id} not found"}, 404
```

</details>

We should verify that the we receive the correct response body and code for a non-existing book. We can do this by making the request in our browser and viewing the server logs.

## Handling an invalid `book_id`

Let's examine the error we receive when making a `GET` request to `/books/hello-world`, an invalid `book_id`, in our browser.

![Invalid book_id response in browser](../assets/api-2-read-error/400-invalid-book-error.png)  
*Fig. Error displayed by Flask in Debug mode when accessing an a book id that doesn't "look" like a book id. ([Original Image](../assets/api-2-read-error/400-invalid-book-error.png))*

### !callout-info

## Flask treats `hello-world` as the `book_id`

Remember that the value of `book_id` comes from a route parameter. Route parameters are parts of URLs, which are strings, even if portions might appear numeric. Flask matches the value of route parameters as a string, and so takes everything after `books/` as the value for `book_id`.

<br />

Flask only sees `book_id` as a parameter to be filled in, and doesn't restrict how it is filled in with any human-intuitive reading of the parameter name. Keeping this in mind, we can write code to handle this scenario.

### !end-callout

We received an error message that should resemble the following.

> ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'hello-world'

The error message doesn't provide a possible diagnosis, as it did in the first case. But even better, it is able to point us to our line of code where the error occurred. We see this in the final stack frame of the Traceback, which lists line 21 of `book_routes.py` as the source of the error (your own message might differ slightly). This is the line in `get_one_book` where we try to convert the matched `book_id` value to an `int`.

We provided the string value `hello-world` as the `book_id` in the URL, and Flask matched this string to the `book_id` route parameter. So this line attempted to convert the string `'hello-world'` to an `int`, which is not possible. Python raises a `ValueError` when we try to convert a string that doesn't represent an integer to an `int`.

### !callout-info

## Sometimes the Line Number Doesn't Tell Us Everything

In the first error we examined, the `TypeError`, we didn't spend time looking at the Traceback for a line number, even though the details provided one. For an exploration of why this was the case, expand the following section.

<br />

<details>
    <summary>Click to review a discussion of the <code>TypeError</code> Traceback</summary>

<br />

The final stack frame reports the error occurring in `app.py` on line 1164. We have no file named `app.py` in our project. Looking carefully at the full path of the file, we see that it's a file located in our `venv`! In other words, this error is in a file that is part of the Flask library that we installed.

<br />

Does this mean the error is in Flask itself? Probably not. Flask is a large project used by many people. It is well tested. While it _can_ contain errors, it's more likely that the error is in the code that _we_ wrote that Flask is running. Remember, we use the `Blueprint` methods to tell Flask to run our code when particular requests arrive. Flask ran our endpoint, but then performed some checks on the result. That's when it detected the issue and raised the error.

<br />

It's a common pattern for libraries to run some piece of code that we provide. If our code doesn't meet the library's expectations, the library will raise an error. The error will be raised in the library's code, but the issue is in our code. Flask did a good job of trying to point us to the actual cause through its error message, but this isn't always the case with all libraries.

<br />

So when debugging an error, the Traceback can be a helpful guide, but it's not always the final word on where the issue is. If the error is reported in library code, it's more likely that there is an issue with our own code, and we'll need to try to figure out what code in our project is related to the issue, and then look through that code to find the problem.

### !end-callout

### Handling an invalid `book_id`: Preparation

To handle this scenario, we should return a response with a response body indicating that the book with `book_id` is invalid and a `400 Bad Request` response code.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
| Endpoint Detail | Notes |
| ------- | ------- |
| Request | `GET /books/hello-world` |
| Response Status | `400 Bad Request` |
| Response Body | `{"message": "book hello-world invalid"}` |
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

### Handling an invalid `book_id`: Code

We can surround the code `book_id = int(book_id)` with a `try/except` that returns a `400` response code in the `except` clause when `int(book_id)` throws an error.

```python
try:
    book_id = int(book_id)
except:
    return {"message": f"book {book_id} invalid"}, 400
```

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
| Piece of Code | Notes |
| ------------- | ----- |
| `try:`<br />&emsp;&emsp;`...`<br />`except:`<br />&emsp;&emsp;`...` | Run the code in the `try` block, jumping to the `except` block if an `Error` occurs |
| `book_id = int(book_id)` | For valid values of `book_id`, this code will convert the `book_id` to an `int`. `book_id` is initially a string since it it a route parameter. If `book_id` cannot be interpreted as an `int`, then `int()` raises a `ValueError` |
| `return {"message": f"book {book_id} invalid"}, 400` | Runs when the `int()` call fails, by raising a `ValueError`. This code results in a `JSON` response body with the `message`, and a status code of `400` (Bad Request). As before, we return a `tuple` whose first value is a dictionary that Flask will convert to the `JSON` response body, and whose second is the response status code. |

    for book in books:
        if book.id == book_id:
            return {
                "id": book.id,
                "title": book.title,
                "description": book.description,
            }

    return {"message": f"book {book_id} not found"}, 404
```

</details>

### !callout-info

## Error Handlers Can Be Specific

Here, the only error we expect to occur is a possible `ValueError` when trying to convert `book_id` to an `int`. We could—and generally _should_—be as specific as possible with our error block so that the reader knows what errors we expect to occur and how we handle them. To do this, we list the type of the error in the `except` statement.

```python
    try:
        book_id = int(book_id)
    except ValueError:
        return {"message": f"book {book_id} invalid"}, 400
```

<br />

If some other truly unexpected error were to occur in our `try` block, it would not be caught by this `except` block. As a result, it would continue to propagate up the call stack, potentially causing a crash. While this may sound extreme, it's usually better for code to crash than to continue running in an unknown state. Here, we only know how to fix a `ValueError`, so really, we should only catch that error.

### !end-callout

Let's verify that we now receive the correct response body and code for an invalid `book_id`. We can do this by making the request in our browser and viewing the server logs.

## Refactor with Helper function

Our `GET` `/books/<book_id>` endpoint now correctly handles `404` and `400` level responses. We may notice that our `get_one_book(book_id)` route function is getting a bit long. The more code we add, the less clear it becomes that this route is really just trying to find a single book and return its details.

Wouldn't it be great if we had a separate function that could find a single book with all the error handling taken care of? Then our route function could just call that function and return the formatted book details. In later lessons, we'll also see that placing this logic in a separate function will make it easier to test. It may even become the basis for a more general function that can be used in other parts of our code, which would be more difficult to do if the logic remained "trapped" in our route, if we even notice the opportunity at all.

While such a function doesn't exist in our project yet, we're coders! We can make it happen!

### !callout-info

## Set Aside Practice Time to Look for Refactors

We shouldn't worry if we don't see the need for a helper function right away. It's a skill that comes with experience. As we write more code, we'll get a feeling for more patterns that can be extracted into separate functions. While splitting up our logic might make a project feel more complex at first, it will make it easier to maintain and extend as the project grows.

<br />

While we are electing to perform this refactor now, it's often more common to wait until we have a few more instances of similar code before extracting it into a helper function. This way, we can be more confident that the function we're creating is general enough to be useful in multiple places. This can also apply to other types of refactors, such as creating base classes for inheritance.

<br />

The more experience we gain, the better we'll become at recognizing refactors that are likely to be helpful even before we have multiple instances of similar code. This is a skill that comes with time and practice, so don't worry if it doesn't come naturally at first. To help us develop this skill, it can be beneficial to set aside specific time to review our code and actively look for repetition that might be a hint that a refactor is needed. We'll see further refactoring examples in later lessons.

### !end-callout

Let's pull out the lookup and related error handling logic into a helper function `validate_book(book_id)` that we will call from `get_one_book(book_id)`. We'll write it so that it returns the book if it finds it, and terminates the request with an appropriate error response if it doesn't. We'll use some new Flask-provided functions to help us with this. Let's take a look!

```python
from flask import Blueprint, abort, make_response  # additional imports

...  # the rest of our code

def validate_book(book_id):
    try:
        book_id = int(book_id)
    except:
        response = {"message": f"book {book_id} invalid"}
        abort(make_response(response, 400))

    for book in books:
        if book.id == book_id:
            return book

    response = {"message": f"book {book_id} not found"}
    abort(make_response(response, 404))
```

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
| <div style="min-width:10em;">New Piece of Code</div> | Notes |
| ----------------- | ----- |
|`from flask import Blueprint, abort, make_response`| Bring in the `abort` and `make_response` functions from Flask. |
| `response = {"message": f"book {book_id} invalid"}` | store the dictionary that will represent our invalid ID response body. This could have been done as part of the next line, but this is a little less noisy. |
| `abort(...)` | The [`abort`](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/api/#flask.abort) function is provided by Flask. By raising an `HTTPException`, it causes the current request to be terminated at the location of the `abort` call. Because of its signature, we can't pass it the response body and status as two separate pieces of data, as we had been returning from our route. Instead, we must give it an actual Flask [`Response`](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/api/#flask.Response) instance that has those values already set. |
| `make_response(...)` | The [`make_response`](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/api/#flask.make_response) function is provided by Flask. It builds a Flask `Response` object. We could call the `Response` constructor directly, but `make_response` tends to be a little easier. We use the result of this call as the argument to the `abort` function, providing details about what response should be sent to the client when the request is terminated. |
| `response, 400` | The arguments to `make_response`. These are our response body dictionary and response status code. As with a route, by giving `make_response` a dictionary, it will assume that we want a `JSON` response, using the dictionary values for that purpose. |
| `for book in books:`... | Iterate through the `books` and return the `book_id` if it is in the list. |
| `abort(make_response(`&ZeroWidthSpace;`response, 404))` | If the loop completes without returning, the book ID was not found. `abort`, and return a `404` response. |
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

## Working with Flask `Response`s

`Response` is a Flask class that represents HTTP responses. Ultimately, anything Flask sends back to a client gets represented as an instance of `Response`. Most of the time, we won't need to work with a `Response` directly, since Flask also allows us to return other values from routes, such as `dict`s and `list`s, and Flask takes care of using them to build a `Response`. But in specific cases, such as our call to `abort` above, we need an actual `Response` instance. One way of doing this is to instantiate a `Response` directly using its constructor.

Flask also provides the helper method `make_response`, which is a little bit more flexible in the arguments it can accept than if we used the `Response` constructor ourselves, so we'll be using `make_response` instead. But we should be aware that it's still creating a `Response` instance internally. We can think of `make_response` as sort of a convenience constructor for `Response`.

For more information about the `Response` class we can refer to the following reference documents.

- [Flask's definition of `Response`](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/api/#response-objects)
- [Flask's quickstart guide on creating responses](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/quickstart/#about-responses), which notably does _not_ feature the `Response` class

There are a variety of ways to create `Response` instances in Flask, some implicit and some explicit. The previous resource links will provide a good starting point for exploring further!

## Using Our Helper Function

With the `validate_book` function in place, we can update our `get_one_book` function to use it.

```python
@books_bp.get("/<book_id>")
def get_one_book(book_id):
    book = validate_book(book_id)

    return {
        "id": book.id,
        "title": book.title,
        "description": book.description,
    }
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
| <div style="min-width:10em;">New Piece of Code</div> | Notes |
| ----------------- | ----- |
| `book = validate_book(`&ZeroWidthSpace;`book_id)` | Use our helper function to look up the `book_id`. It returns the `Book` matching the specified ID. If it fails to find a valid book, for whatever reason, it will raise an Error that Flask will eventually handle. This means we only need to worry about the successful case here in our route. |
| `return { ... }` | Return the dictionary that will be used as the `JSON` response body for the request. We know that `book` will be a valid `Book` instance, because if it weren't, `validate_book` would have raised an Error instead of returning a value. |
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

By moving the lookup logic and its error handling into a separate function, we've made our route function much more focused. It's now clear that the purpose of this function is to return a single book's details. The error handling is still present, but it's been moved to a separate function where it can be more easily understood and maintained.

There's even more we could do to improve this function, but we'll leave that for another time. For now, we've handled several possible errors in our route, and done so while keeping the main responsibility of the route clear and focused.

##### !end-answer

##### !hint

Remember that external libraries are often large, complex pieces of software that tend to be well-tested. It's most likely that the error is somewhere in our own code, and the library is just reporting it.

##### !end-hint

##### !explanation
- Reading the error is often a good source of information to determine whether the issue is in our own code. Different libraries will be better or worse at providing possible causes of the error, but the error message itself is a good place to start our investigation.
- Library code that we install from the internet is usually well-tested and used by many people. While we can't ignore the possibility that there is a bug in the library, it's more likely that the issue is in our own code.
- Libraries often provide ways to register pieces of our own code to run while the library code is handling various supporting work. For example, in Flask we register route functions to run, while Flask is left to figure out which route a request is asking for. If we encounter an error when accessing a particular route, we should look at our code to investigate the issue. This is especially true if there is a problem with a return value from our code, which the library won't be able to check until our code has completed running. This would cause any error to appear as though it were in the library code.
- Library code is code like any other, and we can use our debugger to step through it. However, the complexity of most public library code makes this a difficult and time-consuming task. It's usually better to focus on our own code, and only look at library code if we have a clear reason to believe the issue is there. If we _did_ find an issue in library code, we should report it to the library maintainers so that it can be fixed for everyone, not just in our own local copy.

4. The server encountered an unhandled error, resulting in our code crashing. In debug modes, this might result in a detailed error message being displayed in the browser.

##### !end-answer

##### !hint

Which codes are success codes, which are failure codes, and which are error codes?

##### !end-hint

##### !explanation

- `200 OK`: This is the standard response for successful HTTP requests. The actual response body will contain the details of the requested resource.
- `400 Bad Request`: This is the standard response for requests that are malformed or otherwise invalid. This could be due to a missing parameter, an invalid parameter, or a parameter that is of the wrong type.
- `404 Not Found`: This is the standard response for requests where the server is unable to locate the requested resource. This could be due to a missing file, a missing record in a database, or even a missing route.
- `500 Internal Server Error`: This is the standard response for requests where the server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request. This could be due to a bug in the server code, a misconfiguration, or a problem with the server's environment.

<br />

It's worth noting that not all systems will distinguish between invalid IDs and missing IDs. Some systems will return a `404` for both cases, as it could be argued that whether invalid or missing, the server cannot find a record to fulfill the request. In such cases, it's usually still necessary to write code to validate the incoming ID, even if the response code is the same. For example, failing to do so could result in using the value in an unsupported way, leading to a crash or other unexpected behavior later in our code.
