# Activity: Deploying to Heroku

## Goal

Our goal is to practice deployment of our Flask APIs in a group setting. Deploying in a group setting allows us to share knowledge of deployment, and lets us debug in pairs or groups.

## Preparation

The Hello Books API should be in a working state, such that running `$ flask run` does not produce any errors. To the best of your ability, you should check that no syntax errors, name errors, or other runtime errors occur.

All code for Hello Books API should be pushed to GitHub.

The Solar System API should also be in a working state, and up-to-date on GitHub.

## Activity Instructions

1. Get into pairs or small groups
1. While using individual Hello Books API repos, as a pair/group, follow the "Deploying to Heroku" walk-through step-by-step together
1. When any errors or questions arise:
    - Write down what step/command just created the issue
    - Write down how you observed the issue
    - Pause, debug, and ask for help!

Then, answer the following questions with your pair or small group:

1. If you and/or your group had successful deployment, how did you and/or your group verify the deployment?
1. How would you describe the relationship between our projects, git, and Heroku?
1. Poke around the Heroku dashboard. What is a feature that looks interesting or curious?
1. How would you describe the overall development workflow, from the beginning of a project, to deployment?
1. How would you like to celebrate a successful deployment?

### !callout-info

## Repeat with Solar System API

Our skills improve with repetition. If there is time during the activity, repeat the deployment process with Solar System API. If there is _not_ time, deploy Solar System API as an individual activity.

### !end-callout

## How to Review

1. How would you and your group describe the relationship between our projects, git, and Heroku?
1. What deployment issues did you or your group members encounter and record?
1. How would you and your group describe the overall development workflow, from the beginning of a project, to deployment? Use the following words:
    - git
    - feature
    - local
    - testing
    - production
    - often
