# Problem Set: Deployment

## Directions

Pre-read the activity for this topic.

Prepare your Hello Books API project for deployment. Your Hello Books API should:

- Be able to run with `$ flask run` without producing errors
  - To the best of your ability, you should check that no syntax errors, name errors, or other runtime errors can occur
- Follow git practices, and all code changes should be pushed to GitHub

Prepare your Solar System API project for deployment. Similarly, your Solar System API project should be working and up-to-date on GitHub.
