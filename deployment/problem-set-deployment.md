# Problem Set: Deployment

## Directions

Pre-read the activity for this topic.

Prepare your Hello Books API project for deployment. Your Hello Books API should:

- Be able to run with `$ flask run` without producing errors
  - To the best of your ability, you should check that no syntax errors, name errors, or other runtime errors occur
- Follow git practices, and all code changes should be pushed to GitHub

Prepare your Solar System API project for deployment.

- Perform the same checks as for your Hello Books API project
- Ensure that the latest version is committed and pushed to GitHub
