# Instructor: Data in Tables

- If you're looking for kinds of tables that don't use rows as records, here are some examples:
    - truth tables/logic tables
    - i'd argue calendars
    - tables of contents ;)
    - the cool hazard square code things https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFPA_704
    - artistic ones! i've seen a spreadsheet where each cell looked ilke a pixel of mario (the famous nintendo character). still counts!
