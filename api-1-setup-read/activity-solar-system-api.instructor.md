## Recommended Structure for Flask Topics

   - For C16, Seattle created the [Flasky API](https://github.com/AdaGold/flasky) for the livecode to provide an example in addition to Hello Books.
2. After the livecode, students work in pairs to complete each wave of the [Solar System API project]((https://github.com/adaGold/solar-system-api/))
