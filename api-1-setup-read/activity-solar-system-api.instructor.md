# Instructor: Activity: Solar System API: Setup, Read

## Recommended Structure for Building an API Topics
1. Livecode during roundtables for each of the Flask topics below.
   - For C16, Seattle created the [Flasky API](https://github.com/AdaGold/flasky) for the livecode to provide an example in addition to Hello Books.
2. After the livecode, students work in pairs to complete each wave of the [Solar System API project]((https://github.com/adaGold/solar-system-api/))

The activity docs in each **Building an API** Learn Topics duplicate instructions that are in the README: https://github.com/adagold/solar-system-api. This files could be hidden if instructors prefer to just use the solar-system-api readme and class instructions to indicate the classroom activities. They were left in the repo to give folks the option.
