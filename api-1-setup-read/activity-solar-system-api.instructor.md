# Instructor: Activity: Solar System API: Setup, Read

## Recommended Structure for Building an API Topics
1. Livecode during roundtables for each of the Flask topics below.
   - For C16, Seattle created the [Flasky API](https://github.com/AdaGold/flasky) for the livecode to provide an example in addition to Hello Books.
2. After the livecode, students work in pairs to complete each wave of the [Solar System API project]((https://github.com/adaGold/solar-system-api/))

The activity docs in each **Building an API** Learn Topics were originally designed to be student facing. However, they duplicate instructions that are in the README: https://github.com/adagold/solar-system-api, so Becca marked them as instructor docs in the `config.yaml`. If it is helpful to have visible to students, individual campuses can make that decision and change the `type` to `Lesson` in the `config.yaml` file and reveal to students.
