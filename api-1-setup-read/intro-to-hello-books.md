# Intro to Hello Books

The Building an API Learn lessons walk-through building a Flask API with the companion repo [Hello Books API](https://github.com/AdaGold/hello-books-api)

### Workflow Recommendations

The original Hello Books API repo is owned, written, and maintained by the Ada instructors and curriculum developers. Use this repo as a reference for instructor-led code. We recommend:

1. Cloning this repo directly (without forking) when you want to see and play with the instructor examples
1. Renaming this project folder to `instructor-hello-books-api` to make it clear it's the instructor version
1. Deleting this folder or removing any changes you've made using `git stash` whenever you are done experimenting. This don't leave any of your own changes in this folder will make it possible to get the latest instructor code without introduing conflicts.

### Fork and Clone the Repo for Personal Experimentation

If you are interested in personal exploration of the project, fork this repo to your own account. This will let you have full control over the repo, and you can create and push commits over time.
