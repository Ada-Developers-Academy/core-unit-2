## Introduction: Hello Books Repo

We will use the repo [Hello Books API](https://github.com/AdaGold/hello-books-api).

First, this repo will act as our Flask Hello World. We'll create some basic, experimental features to test that we can run Flask successfully.

Afterwards, we'll use the same Hello Books repo to demonstrate building a book library API.

### Refer to the Repo for Reference

The original Hello Books API repo is owned, written, and maintained by the Ada instructors. Use this repo as a reference for instructor-led code. We recommend:

1. Cloning this repo directly when you want to see and play with the instructor examples
1. Renaming this project folder to `instructor-hello-books-api` to make it clear it's the instructor version
1. Deleting this folder or removing any changes you've made using git whenever you are done experimenting. Ensuring you don't leave any of your own changes in this folder will make it possible to get the latest instructor code without introduing conflicts.
