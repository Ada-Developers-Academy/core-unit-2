## Goals

The goals of this lessons is to create and debug endpoints in Flask.

We will:

1. Define our first blueprint
2. Define our first endpoint, `/`
3. Witness the response of our first endpoint
4. Define our second endpoint, `/hello/JSON`
5. Witness the response of our second endpoint
6. Debug a third, broken endpoint

## Defining Endpoints with Blueprint

Our code will import and use something named `Blueprint` from `flask`. In `routes.py`, let's add this import line.

```python
from flask import Blueprint
```

`Blueprint` is a Flask class that provides a pattern for grouping related routes (endpoints). Flask will often refer to these routes using the word "view" due to Flask having the potential of sending HTML views. However, we will be sending back JSON.

For now, let's focus on how we can use a `Blueprint` in our own code, but for future reference, we should consider:

- [Flask's definition of `Blueprint`](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/api/#blueprint-objects)
- [Flask's tutorial on using `Blueprint`](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/tutorial/views/)

### Creating a Blueprint in `hell_world_routes.py`

In `hello_world_routes.py`, type in the following code:

```python
from flask import Blueprint

hello_world_bp = Blueprint("hello_world", __name__)
```

| --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `hello_world_bp`                                    | The name for a local variable that will hold our Blueprint instance. Whenever we need to use this Blueprint to define a route, we'll use `hello_world_bp`.                                                |
| `Blueprint( ... )`                                  | The syntax for instantiating a `Blueprint`                                                                                                                                                                |
| `"hello_world"`                                     | The first argument is a string that will be used to identify this `Blueprint` from the Flask server logs (in the terminal). It's conventional to use a name related to the data being served or the functionality being provided. Here we are creating a "hello world" style endpoint, so "hello_world" is fine for our needs. |
| `__name__`                                          | The second argument is almost always the special Python variable `__name__`, which the blueprint uses to figure out certain aspects of routing.                                                                                                                                                                                |

### Registering a Blueprint

Every time we instantiate a new `Blueprint`, Flask requires us to register it with `app`. This is a fancy way to say that we need to tell the `app` that it should use the endpoints from `hello_world_bp` for its routing.

_Where_ we register the `Blueprint` depends on the project. For the Hello Books project specifically, the place to do this is in `app/__init__.py`, inside the `create_app()` function.

```python
from flask import Flask
from .routes.hello_world_routes import hello_world_bp


def create_app(test_config=None):
    app = Flask(__name__)

    # Register Blueprints here
    app.register_blueprint(hello_world_bp)

    return app
```

| <div style="min-width:240px;"> Piece of Code </div> | Notes                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `from .routes.hello_world_routes import hello_world_bp`                | We are importing `hello_world_bp` into this module so we may use it inside `create_app`.                  |
| `app.register_blueprint(hello_world_bp)`            | We use `app`'s pre-defined function `register_blueprint()` to register the `hello_world_bp` Blueprint. |

If we needed to create and register more `Blueprint`s, we could follow this pattern and duplicate this code until we needed a better solution.

### Defining an Endpoint

Now that we have registered a Blueprint, which will help us organize our routes, we can create an endpoint in `app/routes.py`.

Recall that the responsibility of an endpoint is to:

1. Match the HTTP verb and request URL of an HTTP request
2. Form an HTTP response to send back to the client

Consider this explanation of syntax for a generic endpoint. An example of a specific endpoint is located later in the lesson.

```python
@blueprint_name.get("/endpoint/path/here")
def endpoint_name():
    my_beautiful_response_body = "Hello, World!"
    return my_beautiful_response_body
```

| <div style="min-width:290px;"> Piece of Code </div> | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@blueprint_name.get(...)`                        | This decorator transforms the function that follows into an endpoint. We use the `.get()` instance method from our Blueprint instance to define what the type of HTTP method (or verb) the request will have.                                                                                                  |
| `"/endpoint/path/here"`                             |  This argument defines the path (or URL) of the request.                                        |
| `def endpoint_name():`                              | This function will execute whenever a request that matches the decorator is received. The function can be named whatever feels most appropriate. |
| `my_beautiful_response_body = "Hello, World!"`      | We must define a response body to return. Here, we're using a local variable `my_beautiful_response_body` to hold a value                      |
| `return my_beautiful_response_body`                 | For each endpoint, we must _return_ the HTTP response.                                                                                         |

## Endpoint #1: `/`

Consider an endpoint definition that would:

- Use the Blueprint `hello_world_bp`
- Match the route `"/"`
- Match the HTTP method `.get()`
- Give a response `200 OK` with the HTTP body `"Hello, World!"`

### !callout-info

## `200 OK` Is the Default Response Status Code

We will see how to set explicit status codes in later lessons. If we don't set the status code ourselves, Flask will use `200 OK` by default.

### !end-callout

We may come up with something such as:

```python
from flask import Blueprint

hello_world_bp = Blueprint("hello_world", __name__)


@hello_world_bp.get("/")
def say_hello_world():
    my_beautiful_response_body = "Hello, World!"
    return my_beautiful_response_body
```

### Manually Testing the Hello World Endpoint

_While the Flask server is running_, we can use Postman to send a `GET` request to `localhost:5000/`.

Hopefully, we see our HTTP response `200 OK` and `"Hello, World!"`!

![Screenshot of Postman after making a GET request to / with a 200 OK response](../assets/building-an-api/flask-hello-books_hello-world-postman.png)

Instead of using Postman, we can alternatively use our browser to make a `GET` request to `localhost:5000/`.

![Screenshot of a browser pointing to localhost:5000/ with the text "Hello, World!"](../assets/building-an-api/flask-hello-books_hello-world-browser.png)

<!-- available callout types: info, success, warning, danger, secondary, star  -->
### !callout-info

## Troubleshooting

Here are a couple quick troubleshooting techniques to try:

</br>

If you are unable to access the server at `localhost:5000/`, replace `localhost:5000` with `127.0.0.1` (i.e. `127.0.0.1:5000/`)

</br>

If you receive the error ‚ÄúAccess to localhost was denied‚Äù, go to **System Preferences** -> **Sharing**, and uncheck ‚ÄúAirPlay Receiver‚Äù.

### !end-callout

## Check the Server Logs

We can use the server logs to debug our server code. After we run `flask run` from the terminal to start the server, any error messages that our server needs to communicate will be printed in that terminal window.

Each time we send an HTTP request to our server, we should see a new line appear in the server log.

```
(venv) hello_books_api $ flask run
 * Environment: development
 * Debug mode: on
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
 * Restarting with stat
 * Debugger is active!
 * Debugger PIN: 231-804-583
127.0.0.1 - - [28/Mar/2021 17:08:19] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```

### !callout-success

## Congratulations on Your First Endpoint!

Congratulations, you made your first endpoint in a Flask API! Congratulations to you and everyone around you! üéâ

### !end-callout

## Endpoint #2: `/hello/JSON`

Consider the code for a _second_ endpoint that would:

- Use the Blueprint `hello_world_bp`
- Match the route `"/hello/JSON"`
- Match the HTTP method `.get()`
- Give a response `200 OK`
- The HTTP response body should be the following JSON-like dictionary. Fill in the response body with your own details.

```json
{
  "name": "Ada Lovelace",
  "message": "Hello!",
  "hobbies": ["Fishing", "Swimming", "Watching Reality Shows"]
}
```

Your code could look similar to this:

```python
@hello_world_bp.get("/hello/JSON")
def say_hello_json():
    return {
        "name": "Ada Lovelace",
        "message": "Hello!",
        "hobbies": ["Fishing", "Swimming", "Watching Reality Shows"]
    }
```

### Manually Testing

We can confirm that we can send a request and get a response back with Postman.

![Screenshot of Postman after making a GET request to /hello/JSON with a 200 OK response](../assets/building-an-api/flask-hello-books_hello-json-postman.png)

We can also confirm that we can send a request and get a response back in the browser. This screenshot showcases a Google Chrome browser extension for viewing JSON, so it's fine if the result doesn't look the same as this.

![Screenshot of a web browser after making a GET request to /hello/JSON with a JSON response body](../assets/building-an-api/flask-hello-books_hello-json-browser.png)

Finally, we can confirm that we can also see output in the server log.

![Screenshot of the terminal with the server log output showing that a GET request to /hello/JSON was made](../assets/building-an-api/flask-hello-books_hello-json-server.png)

### !callout-success

## Congratulations on Your Second Endpoint!

Congratulations on defining your _second_ endpoint! üéâ

### !end-callout

## Endpoint #3: Debugging a Broken Endpoint

Let's place this third endpoint into `hello_world_routes.py`. It is intentionally broken.

```python
@hello_world_bp.get("/broken-endpoint-with-broken-server-code")
def broken_endpoint():
    response_body = {
        "name": "Ada Lovelace",
        "message": "Hello!",
        "hobbies": ["Fishing", "Swimming", "Watching Reality Shows"]
    }
    new_hobby = "Surfing"
    response_body["hobbies"] + new_hobby
    return response_body
```

When we make a `GET` request to `/broken-endpoint-with-broken-server-code`, we will get a `500 Internal Server Error` response.

![Screenshot of Postman after making a GET request to /broken-endpoint-with-broken-server-code with a 500 Internal Server Error response](../assets/building-an-api/flask-hello-books_hello-error-postman.png)

### Use Your Debugging Strategies

Use a combination of Postman, the browser, server logs, the Internet, and your peers. Fix this endpoint so it no longer sends back a `500` response, and instead sends back a `200` response.

Flask's error responses show up nicely formatted in the browser.

![Screenshot of the browser with Flask error messages](../assets/building-an-api/flask-hello-books_hello-error-browser.png)

We should also confirm that we can see the same error output in our server log.

### Fix the Endpoint

The error `TypeError: can only concatenate list (not "str") to list` should help us refactor our code to get a `200 OK`.

![Screenshot of Postman after making a GET request to /broken-endpoint-with-broken-server-code with a 200 OK response](../assets/building-an-api/flask-hello-books_hello-error-postman-fixed.png)

### !callout-success

## Congratulations on Debugging Your Third Endpoint!

You've built and run a pretty substantial web server now, that accepts three different kinds of HTTP requests and gives back three different kinds of HTTP responses! üéâ
