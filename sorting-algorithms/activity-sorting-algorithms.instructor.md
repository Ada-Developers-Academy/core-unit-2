# Instructor: Activity: Sorting Algorithms Jigsaw

### !callout-warning

## Idk if I still like this activity

I wrote this activity because I felt like the most important thing was to get the students to remember how to talk about sorting algorithms. Right now I feel like what's best is to maybe skip on this activity? idk.

## Goal

Our goal is to create a deeper understanding of the different sorting algorithms. We should be researching and finding different resources to help us connect sorting algorithms with different senses.

We should come out of this activity with a more familiarity with all sorting algorithms.

## Preparation and Format

In this activity, we will be learning and then teaching each other, in the format of two rounds: the research round and the teaching round.

In the research round, you will meet with your first assigned group to learn about an assigned topic.

In the teaching round, your research round group will disseminate and you will go into your a second assigned group. It is your responsibility to teach this group about that topic.

Small groups should be prepared. In the teaching round, small groups should consist of one person from each research group.

Example:

Research Round groups:

| Research Group A | Research Group B | Research Group C |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Olivia           | Corinne          | Briana           |
| Annie            | India            | Jayden           |

Teaching Round groups:

| Teaching Group A | Teaching Group B |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Olivia           | Annie            |
| Corinne          | India            |
| Briana           | Jayden           |

## Activity Instructions

Spend 20 minutes with your research group in the research round. Then, spend the rest of the time in your teaching groups. Each person will be responsible for teaching the material to everyone else. Use any materials to teach the others. Using notes and visuals are great options.

### Research Round

Each research group will be assigned one sorting algorithm to research.

For each algorithm, we will research:

- History
- Overview of the algorithm
- How to remember the algorithm
- The Big O complexity
- Any effective videos, visuals, songs, mnemonics, etc.
- Fun facts

### Where to Start

You will want to start with Internet searches and your own notes. Use tutorials, blog posts, social media accounts, etc that you find from the Internet. Try to answer the questions:

1. What's an overview of this sorting algorithm?
1. How can we describe the algorithm?
1. How can remember how the algorithm works?
1. What's the Big O complexity of this algorithm?
1. Are there any effective videos, visuals, songs, mnemonics, etc. that you found?
1. Are there any fun facts about the algorithm that you've found?

#### Challenge Yourself: Optionals

1. Make up a story, poem, diagram, or picture to help describe the algorithm
1. Make up a dance or puppet show that describes the algorithm

### Algorithms

1. Bubble sort
1. Selection sort
1. Insertion sort
1. Merge sort

### Teaching Round

Each member should spend no more than six minutes sharing their information with the rest of the group. The other members should take notes, and look for the answers for these questions:

1. How can I describe this algorithm on a high level?
1. How can I remember the Big O complexity of this algorithm?
1. Are there any interesting resources for me to use later?

## How to Review

1. How can we rank these algorithms on time complexity?
1. How can we rank these algorithms on space complexity?
1. How can we remember the rankings of these algorithms?
