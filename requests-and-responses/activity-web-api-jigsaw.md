# Activity: Web API Jigsaw

## Goal

Our goal is to learn and teach each other about web APIs, what they do, what they can't do, and how to read the documentation.

We should come out of this activity seeing the breadth and diversity of different web APIs. Web APIs have the potential to be about any subject and any data. Their functionalities can differ greatly. The way that their documentation is structured can differ greatly.

## Preparation and Format

In this activity, we will be learning and then teaching each other. We will have two rounds: the research round and the teaching round.

In the research round, you will meet with your first assigned group to learn about an assigned topic.

In the teaching round, your research round group will disseminate and you will go into your second assigned group. It is your responsibility to teach this group about that topic.

Small groups should be prepared. In the teaching round, small groups should consist of one person from each research group.

Example:

Research Round groups:

| Research Group A | Research Group B | Research Group C |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Olivia           | Corinne          | Briana           |
| Annie            | India            | Jayden           |

| Teaching Group A | Teaching Group B |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Olivia           | Annie            |
| Corinne          | India            |
| Briana           | Jayden           |

## Activity Instructions

Spend 20 minutes with your research group in the research round. Then, spend the rest of the time in your teaching groups. Each person will be responsible for teaching the material to everyone else. Use any materials to teach the others. Using notes and visuals are great options.

### Research Round

Each research group will be assigned an API to research.

You will be learning and teaching each other about other APIs, what they do, what they can't do, and how to read the documentation.

### Where to Start

You will want to start the official documentation for the API, any "getting started" tutorials that the API's official website lists, and any tutorials or blog posts that you find from the Internet. You will want to answer the questions:

1. What does this API do on a high level?
1. How is the documentation organized? Are there tutorials? Is there a list of all of the API endpoints?
1. What are some queries (`GET` requests) that any developer using this API can make?
1. What are some commands (`POST` requests) that any developer using this API can make?
1. Do these endpoints give back a response in JSON?
1. For each endpoint that you inspect, does the API document what happens when there's an error?
1. Overall, reflect: What kind of situation is the best time to use this API? What kind of projects could you use this for? If you needed to use this API, how easy was it to read and learn about it?

#### Challenge Yourself: Optional Questions

1. What is the most hidden secret that you can discover in this API? For example, using the Github API, you can find out when a user's birthday is. Is there something surprising, humorous, or strange that you can get from this API?
1. What is something you would predict you could do with this API, but (as far as you can tell) you _can't_ do?
1. Is this API open-source? What does that mean in this case?

### APIs

1. [Instagram's Graph API](https://developers.facebook.com/products/instagram/)
1. [Yelp's Fusion API](https://www.yelp.com/fusion)
1. [OpenWeather's API](https://openweathermap.org/api)
1. [Wolfram Alpha's Simple API (and other pre-built APIs)](http://products.wolframalpha.com/api/)
1. [Open Bank Project](https://www.openbankproject.com)'s API (Direct link to their [API Explorer here](https://apiexplorer.openbankproject.com/)) (Note from the Instructors: This is the weirdest API to read because it relies a lot of domain knowledge about banking. Work on finding an answer, not necessarily a correct answer. ðŸ™‚)
1. [The Color API](https://www.thecolorapi.com) and [TMDb's API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api)

### Teaching Round

Each member should spend no more than five minutes sharing their information with the rest of the group. The other members should take notes, and look for the answers for these questions:

1. What does this API do on a high level?
1. Is there a list of all of the API endpoints?
1. Do these endpoints give back a response in JSON?
1. For each endpoint that you inspect, does the API document what happens when there's an error?

## How to Review

1. Which of these APIs was most interesting to you? Why?
1. Take one minute to consider an API that you would find useful if it existed. What kind of API is it? What is one example endpoint that you would use?
