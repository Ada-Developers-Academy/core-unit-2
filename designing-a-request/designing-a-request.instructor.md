# Instructor: Designing a Request

## Designing JSON Body Responses

Goal:

- The point is to get students to learn that they can shape their JSON meaningfully.
- My hope is that if they learn how to shape it meaningfully, they'll be better equipped to dive into the JSON, too.
- Bonus: Practice for capstone

Notes for teaching:

- The first half is boring, it's stuff that's been taught before
- The second half has an extended metaphor/walkthrough with Eryn, and then it ends in Slack API exploration
